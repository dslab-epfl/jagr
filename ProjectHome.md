JAGR is a Java application server that efficiently recovers applications from a broad class of transient software failures, without requiring any changes to the applications themselves. JAGR is built on top of JBoss and showcases two core recovery-oriented techniques: microrebooting (surgical reboots perform at the sub-application level to recover components from transient failures) and the use of macroanalysis for failure detection (statistical analysis to identify anomalous component behavior).  We have found that the combination of fast detection and cheap recovery can reduce downtime by two orders of magnitude.
