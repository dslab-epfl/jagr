Release Notes for J2EE[tm] Blueprints: Java[tm] Pet Store 1.1.2
===============================================================

KNOWN ISSUES
------------

This section describes known issues with Java Pet Store 1.1.2. Please
read these notes before installing Java Pet Store.

- Anytime you wish to rebuild the Java Pet Store Administrator, you
  must first rebuild the Java Pet Store.

- Whenever you deploy the Java Pet Store applications (or any other
  application, for that matter) on the J2EE Reference Implementation
  (J2EE RI), you should always check to see if an application with the
  same name has already been deployed.

  For example, if an (older) Java Pet Store application is currently
  deployed with the display name "petstore", then you should undeploy
  that application before deploying a newer Java Pet Store application
  with the same name.

- To deploy the Java Pet Store Administrator on J2EE RI 1.3, follow
  these steps:

  1. Start the deployment tool.

  2. From the menu, select File > Open to bring up a file dialog. Go
     to the root directory of the Java Pet Store bundle and select the
     petstoreadmin.ear.

  3. A node named admin should appear in the Applications tree on the
     left panel of the window. Select its child, AdminWebTier.

  4. Select the Security tabbed pane in the right panel.

  5. Click the Settings... button in the top right corner to bring up
     the form-based login dialog. From the Login Page drop-down box,
     select /login.jsp. From the Error Page drop-down box, select
     /error.jsp. Click OK.

  6. Click the Edit... button in the bottom right corner to bring up
     the authorized roles dialog. Select the administrator entry and
     click OK.

  7. From the menu, select File > Save to save your changes.

  8. From the menu, select Tools > Deploy to deploy the application.

- To run the Java Pet Store Administrator's StarOffice and Excel
  demos on J2EE RI 1.3, follow the steps below. Let $JPS_HOME denote
  the root directory of the Java Pet Store bundle. (Win32 users should
  replace the path separator '/' with '\' where appropriate.)

  1. Install the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP), version
     1.1. (Earlier versions will not work.) You can download this from
     http://java.sun.com/xml/download.html.

  2. Replace parser.jar in $JPS_HOME/src/petstoreadmin/src/lib/ with
     the JAXP 1.1 crimson.jar.

  3. Replace jaxp.jar in $JPS_HOME/src/petstoreadmin/src/lib/ with the
     JAXP 1.1 jaxp.jar.

  4. Replace all references to parser.jar in
     $JPS_HOME/src/petstoreadmin/src/build.xml with crimson.jar.

  5. Find the following line in the class
     com.sun.j2ee.blueprints.petstoreadmin.control.web.ManageOrdersBean:

     import com.sun.xml.tree.XmlDocument;

     Replace "com.sun.xml" with "org.apache.crimson".

  6. Rebuild the Java Pet Store Administrator and deploy the rebuilt
     application when running the StarOffice or Excel demo.

- The Java Pet Store Administrator's Excel demo is designed to work
  only with English orders at this time. It will not work with
  Japanese orders.

- The Java Pet Store's Japanese database tables are designed to be
  used only with Cloudscape at this time. They will not work with
  either Oracle or Sybase.

WHAT'S NEW
----------

- The Java Pet Store deploys on the J2EE RI 1.3 without modification.

- The Japanese version of the Pet Store is even more localized.

- JavaDoc documentation has been enhanced for the Java Pet Store
  components.

- Application-level and system-level exception-handling has also been
  improved on all tiers.

- Mini-application: The Blueprints Mailer, a J2EE mini-application
  (see mailerapp.ear) is included. This is the first of many smaller
  J2EE applications targeted at J2SE application developers who want
  to learn how to develop J2EE applications.

- Enhanced portability: Web-tier form-based-login and the
  J2EESecurityAdapter class have been removed. The application now
  uses a servlet-based sign-in/sign-out architecture. Client view JARs
  for the EJB components have also been included.

- Easier installation of database tables: The Java Pet Store provides
  an interactive tool for installing its database tables.
