<b>Overview</b><br>
<br>
J2EE applications are assembled out of components (servlets, JSPs, EJBs);
the way components are configured and connected to each other is specified
at deployment time, with much of this information being stored in a JNDI
namespace. Each component finds other components dynamically, through JNDI
lookups,  not via static linking.  &nbsp;J2EE applications allow for deployment-time
binding, while maintaining type and link safety by having each component
export a list of external components and resources it needs.<br>
<br>
JNDI constitutes the glue that holds together the components of a J2EE application
and is therefore fundamental to the operation of a J2EE system. &nbsp;Its
criticality makes it a prime candidate for isolation. &nbsp;JBoss includes
a JNDI provider (JNP) that can run as a standalone service in a separate
JVM or the same JVM as the application(s) using it. &nbsp;The JNP provides
a lightweight network-accessible JNDI service, that uses solely an in-memory
database to store objects (thus, the namespace's contents does not persist
across restarts).<br>
<br>
If you squint, then you'll realize that JNDI is nothing more than a dedicated
state store. &nbsp;Having J2EE apps use JNDI is an expression of the separation
of persistent state from application logic, as advocated in our crash-only
software paper.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Naming in JBoss</b><br>
<br>
The JNDI provider (JNP) for JBoss is a Java socket/RMI implementation of the
JNDI interface. &nbsp;It can be accessed remotely; the JNP is also optimized
for intra-JVM access, such that it is accessed through an object reference,
rather than over RMI. &nbsp;In JBoss, it is the NamingService MBean that provides
JNDI services. &nbsp;Of its configuration parameters, the following are the
more important ones:<br>
<blockquote>  
  <ul>
    <li><i>Port</i>: The jnp:// protocol listening port; if left unspecified,
the default is 1099 (i.e., the default RMI registry port)</li>
    <li><i>RmiPort</i>: The RMI port on which the RMI NamingService implementation
is exported; if not specified, defaults to zero, meaning any available port</li>
    <li><i>BindAddress</i>: Specific address on which NamingService listens;
useful for multi-homed hosts, defaults to localhost<br>
    </li>
  
  </ul>
</blockquote>
The JBoss JNP started out as a stand-alone JNP, implemented in org.jnp.server.Main.
&nbsp;It was later wrapped into the NamingService MBean to provide the intra-JVM
optimization mentioned above. When NamingService is started, it starts the
JNP's Main; it also exposes its Naming interface ops through JMX, thus enabling
any JMX adaptors to access the JNP (see http-invoker.sar for an example of
how this is done with HTTP).<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Running a standalone JNDI service</b><br>
<br>
Let <i>$JBOSS_TOP</i> be your top-level rr-jboss directory (e.g., ~/ROC/RR/rr-jboss).<br>
<br>
Make sure you have the following directories in your CLASSPATH:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $JBOSS_TOP/system/output/classes &nbsp;(<i>needed for
</i>org/apache/log4j)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $JBOSS_TOP/common/output/classes &nbsp;(<i>needed for
</i>org/jboss/logging)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $JBOSS_TOP/naming/output/classes &nbsp;(<i>needed for
</i>org/jnp/server/Main)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $JBOSS_TOP/naming/output/etc/conf &nbsp;(<i>needed for
</i>log4j.properties)<br>
<br>
Build the JNP. Prior to this, make sure the classes in $JBOSS_TOP/system/output/classes
and $JBOSS_TOP/common/output/classes are current; a top-level build of RR-JBoss
would take care of that.<br>
<br>
Start the standalone server:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; % java org/jnp/server/Main<br>
<br>
If all goes well, you should get output that looks like this (this is a function
of what you have in log4j.properties):<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 0 &nbsp; [main] INFO&nbsp; org.jboss.naming.Naming&nbsp;
- Starting jnp server<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 427&nbsp; [main] DEBUG org.jboss.naming.Naming&nbsp; - NamingServer
stub: org.jnp.server...<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; 559&nbsp; [main] INFO&nbsp; org.jboss.naming.Naming&nbsp; -
Started jnpPort=1099, rmiPort=0, ...<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Configuring JBoss to use the external JNDI provider</b><br>
<br>
Modify ???/jndi.properties to look something like this:<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>java.naming.factory.initial=org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=org.jboss.naming:org.jnp.interfaces</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;<i>java.naming.provider.url=jnp://localhost:1099</i><br>
It is important to provide the URL, because otherwise JBoss will try to use
the in-JVM version of JNDI. &nbsp;The "jnp://" prefix indicates that the JNDI
server should be accessed over JNP (??). &nbsp;It can also be accessed over
HTTP<br>
