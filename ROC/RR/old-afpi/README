The build process and the actual code is dependent on the JBoss
release.  Each subdirectory in this directory is named after the JBoss
release for which that subtree is known to build and do the right
thing.

Choose a subdirectory, according to your JB release, and place it
underneath $JBOSS_TOP (i.e., where the jmx, naming, messaging,
management, etc. directories are).
