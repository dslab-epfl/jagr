<center><h1>Separating JNDI from JBoss</h1></center>

<h3>1. Overview</h3>

<p>J2EE applications are assembled out of components (servlets, JSPs,
EJBs); the way components are configured and connected to each other
is specified at deployment time, with much of this information being
stored in a JNDI namespace.  Each component finds other components
dynamically, through JNDI lookups, not via static linking.  J2EE
applications allow for deployment-time binding, while maintaining type
and link safety by having each component export a list of external
components and resources it needs.

<p>JNDI constitutes the glue that holds together the components of a
J2EE application and is therefore fundamental to the operation of a
J2EE system. Its criticality makes it a prime candidate for
isolation. JBoss includes a JNDI provider (JNP) that can run as
a standalone service in a separate JVM or the same JVM as the
application(s) using it. The JNP provides a lightweight
network-accessible JNDI service, that uses solely an in-memory
database to store objects (thus, the namespace's contents does not
persist across restarts).

<p>If you squint, then you'll realize that JNDI is nothing more than a
dedicated state store. Having J2EE apps use JNDI is an expression of
the separation of persistent state from application logic, as
advocated in our crash-only software paper.

<h3>2. Naming in Vanilla JBoss</h3>

The JNDI provider (JNP) for JBoss is a Java socket/RMI implementation
of the JNDI interface. It can be accessed remotely; the JNP is also
optimized for intra-JVM access, such that it is accessed through an
object reference, rather than over RMI. In JBoss, it is the
NamingService MBean that provides JNDI services. Of its configuration
parameters, the following are the more important ones:

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Port</i>: The jnp:// protocol listening port; if left unspecified,
the default is 1099 (i.e., the default RMI registry port)</li>
    <li><i>RmiPort</i>: The RMI port on which the RMI Naming implementation
is exported; if not specified, defaults to zero (any available port)</li>
    <li><i>BindAddress</i>: Specific address on which NamingService listens;
useful for multi-homed hosts, defaults to localhost<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The JBoss JNP started out as a stand-alone JNP, implemented in
org.jnp.server.Main.  It was later wrapped into the NamingService
MBean to provide the intra-JVM optimization mentioned above. When
NamingService is started, it starts the JNP's Main; it also exposes
its Naming interface ops through JMX, thus enabling any JMX adaptors
to access the JNP (see http-invoker.sar for an example of how this is
done with HTTP).

<h3>3. Running a standalone JNDI service</h3>

<i><u>Note</u></i>: Everything contained in this section is done
automatically by the newly created $JBOSS_TOP/naming/run.sh script.

<p>Make sure the following directories are in your CLASSPATH
($JBOSS_TOP is your top-level rr-jboss directory, e.g.,
~/ROC/RR/rr-jboss):

<p><center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=5>
  <tr align=center>
     <th>Path</th>
     <th>Needed for...</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
     <td>$JBOSS_TOP/naming/output/classes</td>
     <td align=center>org.jnp.server.Main</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
     <td>$JBOSS_TOP/naming/output/classes/org/jnp/server</td>
     <td align=center>Main</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
     <td>$JBOSS_TOP/naming/output/etc/conf</td>
     <td align=center>log4j.properties</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
     <td>$JBOSS_TOP/system/output/classes</td>
     <td align=center>log4j</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
     <td>$JBOSS_TOP/common/output/classes</td>
     <td align=center>org.jboss.logging.Logger</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
     <td>$JBOSS_TOP/messaging/output/classes</td>
     <td align=center>org.jboss.mq.referenceable.ObjectRefAddr</td>
  </tr>

</table>
</center>

<br>

<p>Cut & paste from below, if using tcsh:

<blockquote>
  setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:$JBOSS_TOP/naming/output/classes<br>
  setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:$JBOSS_TOP/naming/output/classes/org/jnp/server<br>
  setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:$JBOSS_TOP/naming/output/etc/conf<br>
  setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:$JBOSS_TOP/system/output/classes<br>
  setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:$JBOSS_TOP/common/output/classes<br>
  setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:$JBOSS_TOP/messaging/output/classes
</blockquote>

<p>Then do the following:

<blockquote>
  cd $JBOSS_TOP/naming/output/classes<br>
  java org/jnp/server/Main
</blockquote>

<h3>4. Configuring JBoss</h3>

<i><u>Note</u></i>: Everything contained in this section has already
been applied to the source tree.

<ol>
  <li>Modify $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/conf/jndi.properties to look like this:

      <blockquote><tt>
         java.naming.factory.initial=org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory<br>
         java.naming.factory.url.pkgs=org.jboss.naming:org.jnp.interfaces<br>
         java.naming.provider.url=localhost:1099</tt>
      </blockquote>

      It is important to set <tt>provider.url</tt>, because otherwise JBoss
      will try to use the in-JVM version of JNDI, to avoid the cost of
      RMI.</li>

  <li><p>In $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/conf/jboss-service.xml, modify
      the entry for JNDI (naming) to look like this:

      <blockquote><tt>
        &lt;mbean code="org.jboss.naming.NamingService" name="jboss:service=Naming"&gt;<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;attribute name="Port"&gt;-1&lt;/attribute&gt;<br>
        &lt;/mbean&gt;</tt>
      </blockquote></li>

  <li><p>In $JBOSS_TOP/server/src/main/org/jboss/naming/NamingServer.java,
      comment out the invocation of naming.start(), to prevent JBoss from
      starting a naming server inside itself.</li>

</ol>

<p>These configurations apply to the <i>default</i> JBoss mode; for
<i>minimal</i> or <i>all</i>, modify the equivalent files in the
<tt>minimal</tt> or <tt>all</tt> directories, respectively.  If you
want to make these changes permanent, make sure to update the files in
<tt>$JBOSS_TOP/server/src/etc/conf/default</tt>.

<p>At this point you can start up JBoss.
