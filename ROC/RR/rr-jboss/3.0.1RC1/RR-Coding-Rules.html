<ul>

<li>Use <i>terse</i> comments liberally throughout your code.

<li>Use javadoc tags to document APIs.

<li>Use a 3-space indentation style.  No TABs.

<li>Use log4j for generating output, not System.println()

<li>CVS log message should chronicle all changes/additions that were
    made as well as the <i>reasons</i> behind those changes.  CVS logs
    serve as an aid to the programmer reading them a year later.  The
    CVS log should contain hard facts only (thus, no
    oppinions/ideas/suggestions -- those belong in an email
    conversation).

<li>Prefix changes in JBoss original files with your acronym (5
    letters or more) in capital letters.  For example:

    <pre>
    // CANDEA start
    // Disable class loader destruction upon EJB undeployment.
    
    ...

    // CANDEA end
    </pre>

    This makes it easy to find RR-related changes later on.

<li>In files that were created by the RR project, <u>do not</u> prefix
    comments and changes with your acronym.  It serves no purpose in
    here.

<li>Use <i>terse</i> comments liberally throughout your code.

</ul>
