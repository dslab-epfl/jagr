<h4>Managing the application</h4>
<ul>
  <li>use the JMX console web application as an example for how to write a
servlet that allows us to restart services (see jboss-all/varia module)</li>
  <li>the f-map will be served as a clickable GIF file (hopefuly the IBM code
can generate a GIF file) with the ability to restart individual components
and have immediate visual feedback</li>
</ul>
<h4>Architecture</h4>
The initial RR proposal talked about adding 3 modules/agents to the execution
infrastructure: a monitor, an oracle, and a recoverer. &nbsp;Considering that
we're doing the automated FI stuff, we could have 4 MBeans: RRFaultInjector,
RRMonitor, RROracle, ServiceController. Each JBoss MBean (extends the JMX
MBean) already provides four methods that are to be invoked by the existing
JBoss ServiceController MBean: <font
 face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">create()</font>, <font
 face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">stop()</font>, <font
 face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">stop()</font>, <font
 face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">destroy()</font>. Therefore, <i>ServiceController</i>
will play the role of the recoverer.<br>
<br>
Here is how things are expected to work:<br>
<br>
RRFaultInjector created by SARDeployer and started manually by the operator,
from the JMX console (web-based)<br>
<ol>
  <li>Tells RROracle that this is just the test mode, so it shouldn't do anything</li>
  <li>Scans the system to figure out what it should inject and where</li>
  <li>For each injectable fault, it tells the service to inject that upon
next request</li>
  <li>Triggers the generation of load (should the load generator be an MBean
as well?)</li>
  <li>Needs to maintain state, in order to know what has been injected so
far</li>
  <li>At some point it needs to figure out that things need to be restarted
to proceed to the next fault</li>
  <li>Once single-point injection is done, proceeds with multi-point injection<br>
  </li>
</ol>
RRMonitor created and started by SARDeployer<br>
<ol>
  <li>Initialized with an empty f-map (or one based on the EJB deployment
descriptors)<br>
  </li>
  <li>Notices injected fault (although has no idea it is injected)</li>
  <li>Notices subsequent failures and updates the f-map appropriately</li>
</ol>
RROracle created and started by SARDeployer<br>
<ol>
  <li>If told to do nothing, does not react to RRMonitor's notifications</li>
  <li>If not told to do nothing, uses the f-map information to decide what
to restart</li>
  <li>Invokes a ServiceController method to restart appropriate service/object
(EJBs?)</li>
</ol>
ServiceController created and started by SARDeployer
<ul>
  <li>Add a method of the form <font
 face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">restart(</font><i>ObjectName</i><font
 face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">)</font> which can be invoked by RROracle</li>
</ul>
<h4>Miscelleaneous Notes</h4>
<ul>
  <li>JMX agent services are objects that support standard operations on
the MBeans registered in the MBean server. &nbsp;Agent services are often
themselves MBeans, so they can be controlled as well. &nbsp;A standard service
that is part of the JMX spec (but not relied upon by JBoss) is the <i>Monitor</i>
service. &nbsp;Monitor services observe an MBean attribute's numerical or
string value, and can notify other objects of several types of changes in
the target. &nbsp;This seems to be a clean way to implement heart beats in
an efficient way.</li>
</ul>
<h4>The Brain</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Takes over the roles of RRMonitor and RROracle</li>
  <li>TheBrain will run on a seperate JVM and possibly a seperate machine over the network.</li>  
  <li>All failure noticies (FailureReport objects) should be send directly to TheBrain using UDP from the EJB/Servlet Containers themselves.  This means that FailureMonitor.java and FMap.java will be obsolete.  </li>
  <li>ClientContainer.java and ServletHolder.java contain examples of sending a FailureReport object to the brain.</li>
  <li>Currently the socket address of TheBrain is hardcoded into the code that sends the message.  This will have to change soon </li>
  <li>TheBrain will start with an empty fault map and infer the fault map as it receives the FailureReport messages.  In the current non-intelligent design, when it receives a failure message, it will also simply restart the failing component as well as any component reachable from it according to the current f-map</li>
  <li>TheBrain will need to send a restart message to some local restart agent(s) to trigger any restarts.</li>
</ul>
