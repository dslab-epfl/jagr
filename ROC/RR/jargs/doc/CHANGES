Changes from 0.2 to 0.3
=======================

- Added 'DoubleOption' class, and 'addDoubleOption()' convenience method
  (suggested independently by Nick Roy and Karl Koster)

- Made 'Option.getValue()' and 'Option.parseValue()' take a Locale, so
  that parsing of values can be locale-dependent. (Locale-specific parsing
  is not however implemented for DoubleOption and IntegerOption.)

- Constructor of 'IllegalOptionValueException' is now public so that it can
  be thrown by the 'parseValue()' methods of custom Option subclasses

- 'CmdLineParser.addOption()' now returns the passed in Option, which
  can make client code less clunky.

- Added 'DoubleOption' to example classes

- Added a 'CustomOptionTest' class to demonstrate subclassing of Option
  via the implementation of a ShortDateOption class.

- Added this CHANGES file.

- Added overridden CmdLineParser.parse() which takes a Locale instance,
  and made both versions of the method final.
