How to build and install SSM
1. Execute ant at current directory. 
   It produces ./ssm.jar.
2. Copy ./ssm.jar to $JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy. 


How to execute bricks
1. cd ./bin
2. Execute the script manualsb.sh with an argument brick id.
   Brick id must be a positive integer.
   Another script brick.sh is available now. This script
   is the same as manualsb.sh except recording its outputs
   to the log file "brickX-log". Where X is the Brick id.  

  Note: You must start several bricks before initializing Stub.
  Note: You can also use ./autobrick.sh command to run several
        bricks at once. 
        usage: ./autobrick.sh {smallest id of bricks} {number of bricks}
3. When you want to kill bricks, use killsb.sh. It kills all
   bricks on this server.

How to use Stub methods 

1. get Stub instance
	Stub st = new Stub(int stub id, 
			   int Number of Write succeed, 
	                   int Number of Write request, 
	                   int Number of read request,
			   int Time out of hearbeat)
2. write to SSM 
	st.Write(int key, Object obj, int expiration);
        return : Vector cookie
3. read from SSM
	st.read(Vector cookie)
	return : Object 


This package includes user friendly version of SSM accessing
methods. ( roc.rr.ssmutil.GlobalSSM )

 initialize stub: GlobalSSM.initialize();
 write to SSM:    GlobalSSM.write(data);
 read from SSM:   GlobalSSM.read(cookie);

See roc/rr/ssmutil/GlobalSSM.java for the details 
Example programs exist in the test directory.
