SSM RUBiS based on  EJB_local_remote_CMP2.0  

              Mar/29/2004 S.Kawamoto

Modification from Http Session RUBiS.
 - SSM RUBiS stores session states into SSM whenever they changed.
   Session states are also placed in the memory as http session RUBiS does.
   Session States are always fetched from the memory except the case they have
   gone because of rebooting web tier. 
 
 - This version of SSM RUBiS still uses http session object and returns
   http cookie "JSESSIONID" and ssm cookie "SESSIONSTATE" to clients.

 - Most of the modifications are in Session class and newly added 
   SessionState class.

Configuration:
 - It is possible to configure to switch off the fanctionality of 
   using SSM. This is controlled by the flag useSSM in Session class.
   Default value of the flag useSSM is true. 

Install:
 0. Check ssm.jar is installed collectly.
    Ssm.jar is expected to be in JBoss's deploy directory.

    This command produces rubis.ear and place it in JBoss 
    deployment directory ($JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy)
