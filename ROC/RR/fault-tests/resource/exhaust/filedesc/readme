MakeFileDesc.java creates directories & files within each directory dynamically based on the size of the 'for' loop.  

When the file descriptor limit was 1024(default) & MakeFileDesc executed without closing the file stream, an exception is thrown (Too many files open).
1024 files created

With the same limit when run with closing the file stream after each file is written it creates numerous files & directories & he disk space runs out. Exception thrown.



When logged in as SU with default limit, same result as above.

As SU changed the ulimit -n 4096.

contunies to run & fails at 4095 files

Changed the ulimit -n 66000

continues till about 50137 files & fails (Too many open files in system)

The same expirement was conducted with 3 shells executing simultaneously.  Exception was thrown at he same time when he total files created by each program added to about 50000.
