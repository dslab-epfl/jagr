/**
 * The methods in this interface are the public face of Controller
 * The Controller is the single remote object that runs on the master
 * machine and with which all other instances of remote servers register.
 * A remote reference to any remote service is obtained by the GUI as 
 * well as the Engine through the controller. Using the controller
 * eliminates the need to run rmiregistry on multiple machines. There
 * is only one remote server object (the Controller) that is known
 * by rmiregistry running on the master machine. Once a reference to
 * the Controller is obtained by the client, it should use the
 * 'getReference' method to obtain a reference to any type of
 * remote server.
