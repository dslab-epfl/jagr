The files in this directory will create the various Oracle databases
for ecperf. 
vxmake.sh - Use to create veritas devices (optional)

createdb.sh - Script to create the database. Pass it the database
			  name and the directory where the database should reside.
			  To create 4 databases, this script must be called 4 times,
			  once for each database.
			  E.g: createdb.sh corp $ORACLE_HOME/dbs/ecperf_db

schema_U.sh - Utilities, needs to be run once against each database.

schema_?.sh - Each schema script will create the tables for that db.
              Edit the section marked ######  datafiles #####
			  to set the pathnames of the Oracle devices appropriately.
			  The default values will work for a filesytem based database.

After all schema scripts are run, the databases should be populated
by running 'bin/loaddb.sh' from the top-level directory.

After you have created and loaded the database, re-start Oracle using 
the $ORACLE_HOME/dbs/initecperf.ora startup file.

stripTbsp.sh - Creates alternate sql schema files not defining the
	       tablespace to populate. This will create the directory
	       sql.noTbsp. The files in this directory are useful for
	       creating the ECperf schema on an existing database
	       and does not need dba or root priviledges. The files
	       in this directory can be run using sqlplus or svrmgrl.

Sizes

You will require 54MB of shared memory for each database during creation.
Each database will require 160MB of disk space for initial creation (thus
640MB total).
However, if you use a single database, you will only need 46MB of shared
memory and 160MB disk space total.
For a scale 1 database, the additional disk space required for loading
the databases are as follows. Note that the space allocation is generous
and will potentially support a much larger scaled database :
corp :  17 MB
ords :  50 MB
mfg  :  22 MB
supp :  38 MB
