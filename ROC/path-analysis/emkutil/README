Use JNDIContext if you want an abstraction around getInitialContext in your
code...

e..g, our clustered petstore uses this helper class to get an initial
context for the clustered lookup server instead of jsut the local one.
switching back to the local lookup server is easy --- just replace the
definition of getInitialContext in one class, instead of everywhere that
new InitialContext() is created.
