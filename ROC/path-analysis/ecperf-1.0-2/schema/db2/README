DB2 Database/Table Build Instructions

Two forms of the build scripts are provided.  One set of .bat files for deployment on
Windows NT and a set of shell scripts for Unix.

Please note that these scripts should be run using the same userid which will
be used when connecting to the datasource.  This will ensure the fully qualified table
names created by the scripts will match the ones accessed at runtime.

For Windows NT based deployments:

From the "$ECPERF\schema\db2" directory, run "blddb.sh $dbname $dbpath"
  Note that:
      Both '$dbname' and '$dbpath' are mandatory parameters.
      '$dbname' must be a valid DB2 database name, and any existing database by that name
      will be dropped first, and then recreated.

      '$dbpath' is the directory where all ECPerf Tables will be stored.  It must be fully qualified meaning that
      the drive letter must be included.  For example, typing the following command will create the ECPerf tables
      in the \ecperfdb directory on the C: drive with a database name of ecperf.
      
      mkdir C:\ECPerfDB
      blddb ecperf C:\ECPerfDB
      

builddb.bat will perform the following functions:
     
  1. Execute createdb.bat
  2. Execute schema_c.bat, schema_m.bat, schema_o.bat, schema_s.bat and schema_u.bat

createdb.bat - drops and creates the database which houses the tables for ECPerf.
schema_x.bat - drops and creates the tables for the appropriate domain (c, m, o, s, u).

Loading the tables:


  1. Update the *db.properties files with the appropriate information.  Assuming the database userid, name and password 
     is ecperf the following would be the entry for the *db.properties.  These files are located in the 
     ECPERF_HOME/config directory.
     
     dbURL =	jdbc:db2:ecperf
     dbUser = ecperf
     dbPassword = ecperf
     dbDriver = COM.ibm.db2.jdbc.app.DB2Driver
     jdbcVersion = 1


  2. To load the tables execute $ECPERF/schema/db2/loaddb.bat



Unix Deployments:

From the "$ECPERF/schema/db2" directory, run "blddb.sh $dbname $dbpath"
  Note that:
    Both '$dbname' and '$dbpath' are mandatory parameters.
      '$dbname' must be a valid DB2 database name, and any existing database by that name
      will be dropped first, and then recreated.

      '$dbpath' must be a valid, writeable path, NOT ending in a slash ('/').  This is the 
      directory where the table spaces will be created.

builddb.sh will perform the following functions:

  1. Execute createdb.sh
  2. Execute schema_C.sh, schema_M.sh, schema_O.sh, schema_S.sh and schema_U.sh

createdb.sh - drops and creates the database which houses the tables for ECPerf.
schema_x.sh - drops and creates the tables for the appropriate domain (C, M, O, S, U).

To load the tables execute $ECPERF/schema/db2/load.sh
