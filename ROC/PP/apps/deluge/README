    You'll note that there is no Makefile or other mechanism for the
installation of Deluge.  That's because I've been doing the install
manually on all my attack machines so far.  The instructions should
explain enough for you to make this happen until I (or some other kind
soul) get an automated install written.

    IMPORTANT: Always check the project home page:
http://deluge.sourceforge.net.  There are pointers there to other
documentation, mailing lists, code updates, and so forth.

    In the tradition of README files being meta-documentation, here's
where to find information you may need:

    INSTALL : how to install Deluge.

    example.dcf : Deluge Config File.  this one has all available
                  controls listed with some explanation.

    docs/script_hacks : After you've run the proxy and generated a
                        playback script, you may want to modify it
                        before running it.  here's some pointers.

    *.pm : When in doubt, read at the code.

    You also might take a look at the docs/todo file, if you're feeling
especially adventurous/altruistic.

	For the basics of running Deluge, try ./deluge --help
