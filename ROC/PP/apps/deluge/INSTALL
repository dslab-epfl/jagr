Perl Requirements
=================
	Perl 5.6.0, at least!  Deluge won't work with anything older.

	Make sure that /usr/bin/perl points to your perl executable.

Deluge installation:
====================

Deluge requires Perl 5.6.0, plus some extra modules. Some of these modules ship
with Deluge, and will work fine if they're left in the deluge directory.
For the rest, the easiest way is to use CPAN (see perldoc CPAN). Like so:

perl -MCPAN -e 'install qw/MD5 MIME::Base64 URI HTML::Parser Time::HiRes \
    Bundle::libnet LWP::UserAgent LWP::Parallel Crypt::SSLeay/'

Note that Crypt::SSLeay requires OpenSSL: <http://www.openssl.org> libraries
and header files. If you're running a linux distribution, this usually means
installing openssl and openssl-devel, or something like that.

This works best if you set up CPAN to follow prerequisites. If you encounter 
errors, try the interactive mode.

perl -MCPAN -e shell

If everything is working, you should be able to execute

deluge --help

and see the usage message.

In case you run into problems, here are the known good module versions:

         openssl-0.9.5a (www.openssl.org, C)
         Crypt-SSLeay-0.16 (cpan, perl)
         MIME-Base64-2.11 (cpan, perl)
         URI-1.06 (cpan, perl)
         HTML-Parser-3.07 (cpan, perl)
         libnet-1.0703 (cpan, perl)
         Digest-MD5-2.09 (cpan, perl)
         libwww-perl-5.48 (cpan, perl)
         Time-HiRes-01.20 (cpan, perl)
         ParallelUserAgent-2.49 (cpan, perl)
         ParallelUserAgent patch (see LWP/Parallel/README)

You'll know that Deluge is in good shape when you can run
	./deluge --help
without errors.
