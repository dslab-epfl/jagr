- installation
  - convert to PAUSE-style module (aka CPAN)
  - rename to HTTP::Deluge or LWP::Deluge or what?
  - provide 'make', 'make test', etc. in Makefile.PL

- playback
  - compare reponse content.  use Algorithm-Diff
  - profiling... where are all the cycles going? LWP overhead?
  - using HTTPD::Bench::ApacheBench for HTTP might result in more
      efficient load generation.

- log evaluation
  - write it to match user-centric
  - response code counts per url, global

- documentation
  - finish _script_hacks_ file
  - write something on how to use dlg_proxy
  - write something on how to assemble an attack

- allow for more than one text regexp for a single URL regexp in
  the V_pos_*/V_neg_* hashes (duh, don't use hashes).

- recording should probably lock the script file while writing.  if
  any of the events start plowing through each other, it'll have to
  be done.

- User.pm is big and messy.  
  - there's too much happening in it; it
    should probably be broken into several different classes.  Maybe
    a userdef class for the stuff from the config file, maybe a proxy
    class.  anything else?
  - split dynamic (per-user) from static (config per-userdef)

- an "include" directive in the configuration file would be nice, so
  that you could put all your user definitions in different files, and
  just "include" them into the top level dcf.

- check for the existance of the log file, and bail out if it already
  exists.  i've overwritten too many useful log files this way.
  better: auto-store run info in a time-date-stamped subdir.

- get Parallel::UserAgent to do secure requests, like it says it does.

- verify off-site links, but don't parse.

- parallel lists are so LISP.  be more perl5.

- make config file parser more elegant: XML?
  - tags should have data flags with them to lose the multiple quasi-switches

- make a second proxy server that acts as a live dlg_eval.  calling up a
  url in the log file creates a page where the requested url is in a
  subframe, and surrounding it are the stats from the logfile for that
  page.
