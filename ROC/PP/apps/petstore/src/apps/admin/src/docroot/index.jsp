    The Java Pet Store Admin Client showcases how the J2EE platform technologies
    along with the Java WebStart technology can be used to deploy Rich client
    interface for customers. For more information on Java WebStart please refer
    to <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">

    In this sample application, we showcase how the Java Pet Store 
    administrator can have the facility of a rich client to get information of
    sales, revenue, orders with specified state. The administrator can also 
    approve / deny pending orders.
