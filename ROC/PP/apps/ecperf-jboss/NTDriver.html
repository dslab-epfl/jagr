<P><B>Driving an ECPerf Workload from an NT environment</B><BR>
</P>
<P>To drive ECPerf on a System Under Test (SUT) a batch file is provided that
will allow a Windows NT system as the driver. The batch file is called
<B>Driver.bat</B>. Several environment variables that pertain the to both the driving system
and the SUT.<BR>
<BR>
To use this batch file edit it and modify the various entries for environment
variables. These variables define the location of various files, classes
and driving configuration. For each of the variables a brief explanation
of the variable is provided along with a recommended setting if appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
Once the updates are completed the batch file can be invoked to start a
run. There are four stages to a run. Each stage is separted from the other
with a simple Pause in the batch file. Once the stage is complete press
enter and the next stage will begin.<BR>

2. Start the controller. <BR>
<BR>
3. Start the various domain daemons. They include the Orders, Manufacturing
and Large Order Line. <BR>
<BR>
