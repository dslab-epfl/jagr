To create the clustered petstore, follow the following steps.

1. modify petstore
     -> make sure initialcontext() is set to look at HA-JNDI on port 1100 for all
        EJB lookup queries, but not the datasource/DAO/JDBC lookups.
        (use emkutil.JNDIContext.getInitialContext()
     -> for all *.*.*.util.JNDIName classes, (in both the src/petstore/src and the
             src/component/src directories, change all the "java:comp..." JNDI names
             for EJB names to be of the form "TheOrder", "TheAccount", "TheBean", etc...

2. build petstore

3.a unjar petstore.ear
3.b rm *Ejb.jar
    and edit META-INF/application.xml to remove references to old Ejb.jar's just removed.
3.c rejar files as as petstore-web.ear


4.a. copy emk-util.jar to $JBOSS_HOME/server/$CONFIG_NAME/lib
4.b. deploy petstore.ear onto N nodes in the cluster
       -> make sure you have a separate configuration directory for each
          node in the cluster, otherwise log files and tmp/ directory
          for each node will conflict on shared file system.
4.c. deploy petstore-web.ear onto another node in the cluster.
4.d. follow the steps for configuring jboss for petstore included in
     mauricio's  (e.g., copying cloud*.jar ...)

   
5. point your web browser to petstore-web.ear's node, and see if it works!

----

speed up step 4 with a shell script!
  -> prepare-petstore-cluster.sh [numnodes]
     (this script makes numnodes number of backend nodes, and one frontend node)
  -> important note: this script copies cloudscape-service.xml from 
     $PETSTORE_HOME/clustering/cloudscape-service.xml, which assumes that
     the cloudscape DB is running on x32.millennium.berkeley.edu.  If that's
     NOT the case, be sure to change the two places in this config file which
     refer to the URL of the database.
