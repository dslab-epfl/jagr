                     ECperf Kit Release Notes
              Version 1.1 Proposed Final Draft, Dated 4/01/02

Installation Instructions

1. We recommend that you create a new user account (say 'ecperf')
   whose home directory is where you will install the kit.
2. Untar the kit and read the file README.html in the top-level
   directory and follow its directions closely.

Enhancements made in this release :

1. The BMP code now provides transaction consistency (see Clause
   4.11.6 of the ECperf 1.1 specification) by using optimistic 
   concurrency control techniques.

2. The design of the supplier emulator has been changed to create
   a thread to handle the response to the supplier. The emulator
   has also been made more robust by re-trying responses in case
   of failure.


The bugs fixed in this release are listed below. Each bug lists the
following information : 
    BugId       - identifier for the bug 
    Synopsis    - brief summary of the bug 
    Description - a more detailed account of the bug
    Fix         - the actual fix made

1. Bugid         4642747
Synopsis      In the SupplierCompEnt.java ejbCreate method returns null
Description    In the SupplierCompEnt.java ejbCreate method is returning 
               null instead of returning new 
               SuppCompEntPK(suppCompID, suppCompSuppID);

Evaluation    The code has been fixed as described.


2. Bugid         4643455
Synopsis      2 errors in creating ECperf database on Sybase ASE
Description   These 2 errors in the code are causing errors when
              creating ECperf database on Sybase ASE. Both
              ECperf 1.0 and 1.1 codes have these errors. I've
              check the bug report and seemed like they were
              not reported.
 
              1. Error on ECPerf code
               src/com/sun/ecperf/load/LoadOrds.java line 409
                    C_Customer should be C_customer
               This is the table name which all other places are
               using C_customer
 
              2. Example for Sybase db properties should ends 
              with "/ecperfdb" instead of "/ecperf", since the 
              createdb script creates the database with name "ecperfdb".
              This is the correct URL to use for using 
              com.sybase.jdbc2.jdbc.SybDriver:
                  jdbc:sybase:Tds:host:port/ecperfdb

Evaluation    The JDBC URL string for Sybase and LoadOrds code 
              have been fixed


Bugid         4649216
Synopsis      detail file has data for 48 hrs even though the run is short
Description   The driver dumps out 48 hrs of data in Orders.detail file even
              though the run is for only couple of minutes

Evaluation    The Mfg and Orders Report code were modified to stop writing to
              detail file if the value is 0.


Bugid         4651057
Synopsis      Increase the block sizes to 10000 for all the u_sequence entries
Description   Increase the block sizes to 10000 for all the 
              u_sequence entries, the change is being done as a 
              precautionary measure to avoid SequenceEnt from 
              becoming a bottleneck.

Evaluation   The code has been fixed as described.


Bugid        4651036
Synopsis     EntityContext.setRollbackOnly() should be called before 
             throwing DataIntegrityException
Description  for code throwing the DataIntegrityException ensure 
             EntityContext.setRollbackOnly() is called before throwing 
             the exception to make sure the Transaction is rolled back

Evaluation   The code has been fixed as described.

Bugid        4652502
Synopsis     Calling findByPrimaryKey is not allowed within the
             setEntityContext method
Description  We are trying to get ECPerf running for our AppServer 
             and came across something we feel is non-compliant with 
             the EJB specificatition (ie it causes problems for our 
             container)

             The problem is with the use of findByPrimaryKey from 
             inside setEntityContext - For example see 
             CustomerCmpEJB.java where it does

             rule = ruleHome.findByPrimaryKey("discount");

             This seems in violation of the EJB Specification
             EJB spec 1.1 final release 9.1.6 Operations allowed in 
             methods of the entity bean class p111.Table 4. 
             Specifically, this table does *not* allow for 
             "Enterprise Bean Access" from within the 
             setEntityContext method.

Evaluation   The code which calls findByPrimaryKey was moved out of
             setEntityContext method
