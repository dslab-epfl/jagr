/**
 * Scheduler is a wrapper to the Jini scheduler and thread pool
 * that schedules tasks to be run at a later time. Tasks will
 * be run using the thread pool. It has the inner classes
 * Scheduler.Task and Scheduler.Task.Runner.<br>
 * Scheduler.Task is the task Scheduler inserts into the Jini scheduler
 * which is run in the scheduler's thread. It simply inserts a runner
 * into the tread pool.<br>
 * Scheduler.Task.Runner gets inserted into the thread pool and calls the
 * actual task.<br>
 * Servlet clients just simply construct a Scheduler and call Schedule
 * to schedule the task.
